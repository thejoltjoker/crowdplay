## About

AI proompted realtime multiplayer quiz game.

### Notes

- I started this project with the idea of proompting the entire thing.
- Loved it at first, super quick iterations and basic funcitonality.
- Hated it because I ended up just wrestling with prompts and the AI agents trying to redesign the layout with every edit.
- Ended up writing the core functionality from scratch.
